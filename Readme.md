# Problem we solve
There are many networks connecting businesses to consumers in today's world. However, many people can still not access it because of a lack of technological knowledge, so we are working to support them by connecting small shops of their local with big companies to take advantage of technology. This enables faster growth and wider market spread as the extent can reach unconventional markets not previously tapped by digital marketing.
# Benefits of society and users
* There are networks connecting businesses to consumers in today's world. However, many people can still not access it because of a lack of technological knowledge, so we are working to support them by connecting small shops of their local with big companies to take advantage of technology.
* We are using Blockchain for this which is not used yet for this, which ensures security, transparency, immutability, and decentralization.
# Challenges we ran into
* We are beginners in this technology so finding lot of stuff about this on internet.
* We learned about blockchain technology and the ethereum network from scratch.
* We learned about developing Dapps and deploying them on the ethereum network.
* We encounter many common errors and mistakes in truffle and npm during the development of Dapp, so learn to debug it.
* For reducing the gas fee we have to interact with IPFS also.
